KubeEdge-Wireless Working Group Proposal

# KubeEdge-Wireless Working Group Proposal

Author: Jason Ning

### **Target:** 

- Our goal is to make an open platform to enable **Wireless**-Edge computing, extending native containerized application orchestration capabilities to hosts at **Wireless**-Edge, which built upon kubernetes and provides fundamental infrastructure support for **Wireless**-network, app deployment and meta-data synchronization between cloud and **Wireless**-Edge.
- **Extend** KubeEdge to support **wireless mobile scenarios**.

### Intention:

- With the development of computing and communication technologies, powerful computing equipments constitutes multi-agent systems. The agents have both computing and comunication capacities and interact with each others. Therefore, the problem of wireless agents interaction between multiple agents and system management is the main scenario discussed here. 
- The communication relationship between different Kubeedge nodes can not be easily seen as connect or disconnect,  it should be more fine-grain communication management.

#### Scenario：

##### 	Vehicle Network/Vessel network/UAV network:

**Key differences** between wireless and wire:  

- Communication mode may need to change from TCP, IP mode to multi-cast or broadcast mode.
- Network for dynamics scenarios.  

With the development of computing, powerful computing equipment could be seen as multi-agent. Therefore, the  problem of wireless interaction between multiple agents is the main scenario discussed here. 

**Description**:  In the mobile scenario, multiple vehicles support similar service, and each vehicles wireless connected with each other as a KubeEdge node. (e.g. NIO ET7 with NVIDIA Orin * 4 , which has computing power of 1016 TOPS)

- Off-line autonomy and node management: Five cars form an mesh network, which can trans information processing between each other in off-line conditions.
- Leader Selection: Choose a pod as cluster head, to do the overall management of other equipments.
- KubeEdge-wireless should monitor the whole or partly state of network, to aid in networking decisions.
- According to the Service Level Agreement, KubeEdge makes decisions on the networking mode and limits the networking scope.
- Inspired by 3GPP 36.885 standards.

##### **Air/Sea rescue Collaboration：**

- The environmental complexity of the sea and sky makes communication more difficult
- The lack of base station support in this scenario necessitates a change in the communication mode.
- The search area is enlarged, but the individual energy is limited, and cluster head is needed for management.
- It is necessary to study the dynamic network structure topology to cope with the constantly changing environment of airspace and sea area.



**Proposal:**

- Kubeedge has the ability to manager the complex wireless networking statue without sensing by service.
-  Blurring the boundary between cloud and edge cloud gives KubeEdge more combination ways.
- Explore the requirements for kubeEdge in wireless scenario. 

#### To-Do：

- With the change of networking mode, the traditional communication mode of KubeEdge needs to be extended.

- Topologies will constantly changing, and the scheduling of communication capabilities will become a critical issue.

  - Willing to consider the situation of poor network channel quality.
  - Actively consider the network instability caused by mobility, especial for users joint and exit suddenly.
  - Active feedback to adjust the network, active networking.
- Cloud Native capability down sinking

  - Enable the edge devices to self-organize network and partial autonomy when off-line or discontinuous network. 

  - In most cases, multiple edge devices may spontaneously network to form a small group, and the outside world can join or quit the group.



#### Architecture:

- Provide management abilities for Edge Cluster when disconnecting from the Cloud by selecting an Edge Head; 
- Add Network profiler module to monitor and manage the Edge cluster network resources, which can provide network information for the Edge Head section;
- Edge Cluster management in the dynamic network environment by creating Edge mesh network and the Edge Head
- Support wireless mesh mode for networking, which allow kubeEdge computing nodes quickly  join and exit mesh networking in mobile scenario.
